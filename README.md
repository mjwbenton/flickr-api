# @mattb.tech/flickr-api

**Deprecated: I no longer use this as I've made a graphql wrapper around all the services holding my data that I interact with: [mattb.tech-graphql-api](https://github.com/mjwbenton/mattb.tech-graphql-api)**

NPM package that presents a simple interface for parts of the flickr API I have used in other projects.
